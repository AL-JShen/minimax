<h1>Minimax</h1>

This project was created in order for me to practice building applications with ReactJS and 
to get a basic understanding of artificial intelligence search algorithms. 


The end goal is to have an AI that plays tic-tac-toe without ever losing. The minimax 
algorithm, along with alpha-beta pruning, and hopefully, progressive deepening, will be 
implemented in order to achieve this. The theoretical knowledge comes from Lecture 6 of MIT's 
6.034 (taught by Prof. Winston). This lecture is available at 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STjW3eH0Cik. 


Some (if not most) of the code is likely to be messy, clunky, and inefficient. Furthermore, 
most of it is not commented. If anyone has suggestions or criticisms, please let me know.


Current state: functional tic-tac-toe game vs self, no AI yet
